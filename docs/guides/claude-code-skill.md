# Litchi Skill for Claude Code

Use Litchi directly from Claude Code CLI with the `/paca` and `/paca-setup` slash commands. Once installed, Claude will use your Litchi workspace for tasks, documentation, and sprint management — instead of creating local files.

## Install

Run the installer (works on macOS and Linux):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Paca-AI/paca/master/scripts/install-claude-skill.sh | bash
```

> **Security note:** Review the script before running it — `curl | bash` executes remote code directly. You can inspect it at the URL above, then run `bash scripts/install-claude-skill.sh` from a local clone instead.

Or, from a local clone of this repo:

```bash
bash scripts/install-claude-skill.sh
```

The installer copies two skill files to `~/.claude/commands/`, making `/paca` and `/paca-setup` available in every Claude Code session.

## Configure the MCP server

The skill requires the Litchi MCP server to be connected. After installing the skill, run `/paca-setup` inside a Claude Code session for an interactive setup walkthrough, or follow the quick steps below.

### Quick setup — Claude Code CLI

```bash
claude mcp add paca \
  --env PACA_API_KEY=<your-api-key> \
  --env PACA_API_URL=<your-paca-url> \
  -- npx -y @paca-ai/paca-mcp
```

Replace `<your-api-key>` (from Litchi → Settings → API Keys) and `<your-paca-url>` (e.g. `http://localhost:8080` or your hosted URL).

### Project-level setup (recommended for teams)

Create `.claude/mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paca": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@paca-ai/paca-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PACA_API_KEY": "<your-api-key>",
        "PACA_API_URL": "http://localhost:8080"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Security:** Do not commit API keys. Add `.claude/mcp.json` to `.gitignore` or inject `PACA_API_KEY` from your shell environment.

### Claude Desktop

Add to the config file for your OS:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "paca": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@paca-ai/paca-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PACA_API_KEY": "<your-api-key>",
        "PACA_API_URL": "http://localhost:8080"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop after saving.

## Commands

All commands read your Litchi documentation first — before taking any action, Claude calls `list_documents` and reads the relevant docs so it understands the project context. Documentation updates are always written back to Litchi Docs via `update_document` or `create_document`, never as local files.

### `/paca <request>`

General-purpose Litchi operations in plain English. Routes to the right tool based on intent.

```
/paca Fix the login redirect bug, assign to sprint 3
/paca What's in the current sprint?
/paca Mark task #42 as done
/paca ABC-17 is blocked — add a comment: needs design review
```

### `/paca-epic <requirements>`

Converts requirements into a structured epic: creates the parent task, breaks it into child stories, and writes a spec document — all in Litchi.

```
/paca-epic As a user I want to reset my password via email
/paca-epic #12   ← turn an existing requirement task into a full epic
```

### `/paca-clarify <task-or-doc>`

Reads a task or document, identifies ambiguities (scope gaps, missing edge cases, undefined terms), asks targeted questions, then updates the spec in Litchi with the resolved content.

```
/paca-clarify #42
/paca-clarify ABC-17
/paca-clarify "OAuth Integration Spec"
```

### `/paca-breakdown <task>`

Decomposes a task or epic into smaller, independent, estimable sub-tasks and creates them in Litchi.

```
/paca-breakdown #42
/paca-breakdown ABC-17
```

### `/paca-sprint`

Plans a sprint: reads the backlog and project roadmap, recommends a task set that fits stated capacity, then assigns tasks to the sprint and sets the sprint goal.

```
/paca-sprint
/paca-sprint next sprint, 30 points capacity
/paca-sprint sprint 4, goal: ship the auth flow
```

### `/paca-estimate <task(s)>`

Estimates story points for one or more tasks using the Fibonacci scale, with reasoning, then writes the estimates back to the tasks.

```
/paca-estimate #42
/paca-estimate #42 #43 #44
/paca-estimate          ← estimates all unestimated tasks in the current sprint
```

### `/paca-prioritize`

Scores tasks by business value, urgency, effort, and dependencies against the project roadmap, then updates their priority fields.

```
/paca-prioritize
/paca-prioritize #42 #43 #44
```

### `/paca-do <task>`

Executes a task end-to-end: marks it in progress, reads all relevant docs, does the work (code, writing, research), then marks it done and updates any affected Litchi documentation.

```
/paca-do #42
/paca-do ABC-17
```

### `/paca-test <task>`

Derives test cases from acceptance criteria, runs them, and posts results as a task comment. Advances the task status on pass, reverts to in-progress on fail.

```
/paca-test #42
/paca-test ABC-17
```

### `/paca-doc <task-or-topic>`

Writes or updates a document in Litchi Docs. Reads existing docs first to match tone and avoid duplication.

```
/paca-doc #42                          ← document the feature in task #42
/paca-doc "API Authentication Guide"   ← create a new guide
/paca-doc ABC-17 update                ← update an existing doc
```

### `/paca-setup`

Interactive setup wizard. Walks you through connecting Claude Code to your Litchi instance and verifying the connection.

```
/paca-setup
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `PACA_API_KEY` | Yes | — | API key (Litchi → Settings → API Keys) |
| `PACA_API_URL` | No | `http://localhost:8080` | Your Litchi instance URL |

## Make Litchi the default for your project

To make Claude always prefer Litchi tools in a project (without needing to type `/paca` every time), add this to your project's `CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Project management

This project uses Litchi for all project management. When working in this codebase:

- **Tasks and to-dos** → use `create_task` / `list_tasks` via the Litchi MCP tools. Do not create local TODO files or add TODO comments.
- **Documentation** → use `create_document` / `update_document` via Litchi MCP. Do not create standalone `.md` docs unless they belong in the repository (e.g. README, CONTRIBUTING).
- **Sprint planning** → use `create_sprint` / `list_sprints` via Litchi MCP.

If Litchi MCP tools are not available, say so and ask the user to run `/paca-setup`.
```

## Uninstall

```bash
rm ~/.claude/commands/paca.md ~/.claude/commands/paca-setup.md
```

## Available tools

See [mcp-server-setup.md](mcp-server-setup.md) for the complete tool reference.
