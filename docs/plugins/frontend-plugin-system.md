# Frontend Plugin System

## Overview

The Litchi frontend plugin system is built on **Vite Module Federation** (via `@module-federation/vite`). The core `apps/web` application acts as the **host**. Each plugin ships as a **remote entry** — a separately built JavaScript bundle that exposes React components through a well-known contract defined by `@paca-ai/plugin-sdk-react`.

Plugins are loaded lazily when the user first navigates to a surface that has an active plugin registered for it. No plugin code is fetched until it is needed.

## Concepts

### Remote Entry

Each plugin build produces:
- `remoteEntry.js` — the Module Federation remote entry, served from the plugin's CDN URL.
- `plugin.json` — the plugin manifest (also read by the backend).
- Optional static assets (CSS, images) co-located with the remote entry.

### Extension Point Registry

At application startup the host fetches the list of enabled plugins from the API (`GET /api/v1/plugins`). Each record contains:

```ts
interface InstalledPlugin {
  id: string;               // e.g. "com.paca.bdd"
  version: string;          // semver
  remoteEntryUrl: string;   // CDN URL to remoteEntry.js
  extensionPoints: ExtensionPointRegistration[];
  config: Record<string, unknown>; // plugin-defined public config
}

interface ExtensionPointRegistration {
  point: ExtensionPointId;  // e.g. "task.detail.section"
  component: string;        // exported component name in the remote module
  label: string;            // display label used in drag-to-reorder UIs
  order: number;            // default render position (ascending)
  scope?: string;           // e.g. a projectId for project-scoped points
}
```

The host builds an **Extension Point Registry** — a `Map<ExtensionPointId, ExtensionPointRegistration[]>` — and makes it available to all host components via a React context (`PluginRegistryContext`).

### Plugin Context

Each plugin component receives a strongly-typed **context prop** from the host. The context shape is specific to the extension point:

```ts
// task.detail.section
interface TaskDetailContext {
  taskId: string;
  projectId: string;
  task: TaskSummary; // read-only snapshot
  permissions: ProjectPermissions;
  sdk: PluginSDK;
}

// sidebar.project.section
interface ProjectSidebarContext {
  projectId: string;
  permissions: ProjectPermissions;
  sdk: PluginSDK;
}

// project.settings.tab
interface ProjectSettingsContext {
  projectId: string;
  permissions: ProjectPermissions;
  sdk: PluginSDK;
}

// view
interface ViewContext {
  projectId: string;
  viewId: string;
  filters: TaskFilters;
  permissions: ProjectPermissions;
  sdk: PluginSDK;
}
```

The `PluginSDK` object exposes the plugin's backend API client (scoped to `/api/v1/plugins/{pluginId}/`) and a set of UI utility functions (toast, confirmation dialog, navigation). Plugins **cannot** import Litchi's internal React Query cache or TanStack Router instances.

## Host-Side Implementation

### `PluginRegistryContext`

```
apps/web/src/lib/plugins/
  registry.ts          ← fetches installed plugins, builds the registry
  context.tsx          ← React context + provider
  loader.tsx           ← lazy remote component loader with error boundary
  extension-point.tsx  ← <ExtensionPoint id="task.detail.section" ctx={...} />
```

#### `<ExtensionPoint>`

The primary rendering primitive. Renders all registered components for a given extension point in order:

```tsx
<ExtensionPoint id="task.detail.section" context={taskDetailCtx} />
```

Internally it:
1. Looks up registrations from the registry context.
2. For each registration, lazily loads the remote component with `React.lazy` + dynamic `import()` via Module Federation.
3. Wraps each in an `<ErrorBoundary>` so a broken plugin cannot crash the host.
4. Passes the typed context as a prop.

#### `<PluginSlot>`

A lower-level primitive for rendering a single named slot in a layout (used for sidebar sections):

```tsx
<PluginSlot
  point="sidebar.project.section"
  scope={projectId}
  context={sidebarCtx}
/>
```

### Extension Point Placement

The following host components become **aware** of extension points after implementation:

| Host Component | Extension Point Rendered |
|---|---|
| `app-sidebar.tsx` | `sidebar.general.section` |
| Project sidebar section in `app-sidebar.tsx` | `sidebar.project.section` |
| Task detail drawer/page | `task.detail.section` |
| Project settings page | `project.settings.tab` |
| View selector / board area | `view` |

### Drag-to-Reorder

Extension point registrations include an `order` field. The **super admin** can reorder plugin panels within a surface (e.g., reorder task detail sections) from the admin settings UI. The order is persisted as a system-wide setting via `PATCH /api/v1/admin/plugin-extension-settings` and applied for all users on load.

## Plugin Build Setup

A plugin's frontend uses Vite with `@module-federation/vite`:

```ts
// vite.config.ts (plugin)
import { federation } from "@module-federation/vite";

export default {
  plugins: [
    react(),
    federation({
      name: "paca-plugin-bdd",
      filename: "remoteEntry.js",
      exposes: {
        "./TaskDetailSection": "./src/TaskDetailSection.tsx",
        "./ProjectSettingsTab": "./src/ProjectSettingsTab.tsx",
      },
      shared: ["react", "react-dom", "@paca-ai/plugin-sdk-react"],
    }),
  ],
  build: { target: "esnext" },
};
```

Shared libraries (`react`, `react-dom`, `@paca-ai/plugin-sdk-react`) are marked as shared so the host's singleton instances are used. This prevents duplicate React instances and ensures the plugin SDK is the same object the host provides.

## Content Security Policy

The server must allowlist plugin CDN origins in the `Content-Security-Policy` header:

```
Content-Security-Policy:
  script-src 'self' https://plugins.paca.app https://cdn.example.com;
  connect-src 'self' https://plugins.paca.app;
```

Plugin CDN origins are configurable per-installation in the server config.

## Error Handling

Each remote component is wrapped in an `<ErrorBoundary>`. If the remote entry fails to load (network error, version mismatch) or the component throws at render time, the boundary renders a non-disruptive inline error with a "Retry" option. The rest of the page remains functional.

## Plugin Extension Settings

The **super admin** can configure system-wide extension point settings:
- **Hide** individual plugin panels per extension point for all users.
- **Reorder** panels within an extension point for all users.

Settings are stored in `plugin_extension_settings` (keyed by `plugin_id` + `extension_point`, no user scope) and applied by the host when building the plugin registry for every user.

## Security Considerations

- Plugin bundles are loaded over HTTPS only.
- The host never passes authentication tokens or internal session state to plugins; plugin HTTP calls are authenticated via the same session cookie as the host (same-origin or subdomain with `credentials: "include"`).
- Plugins are executed in the same browsing context as the host. For higher isolation (untrusted third-party plugins), future work can sandbox plugins in `<iframe>` elements with `sandbox` attributes.
- Plugin code is not run through any host-side eval; Module Federation uses standard ES module loading.
